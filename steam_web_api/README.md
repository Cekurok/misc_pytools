#### Steam API Scripts
This will be a repository of various scripts that I develop using the Steam API
both version 1 and version 2. It is mainly a fun way for me to poke around with
the API and also get better practice at working with json dictionaries in
python.
- **get_current_players.py** - this script will iterate through all games it
  can find in steam and output the number of players currently playing that
  game.

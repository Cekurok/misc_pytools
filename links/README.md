# links
simple python script that grabs href links. 
# how to use:
    python links.py <example.com> 
will return a list of links seperated one per line. I like to use this in sysadmin work to solve the insecure link issue that can occur on webpages with many hard-coded URLs when an SSL certificate is installed.
